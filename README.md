# Explainable-recommended-systems

Dataset: Good reads 
In this system, the following 2 things were achieved:


1. Title Suggestion: We built a simple regressor to predict the book rating. This model can be used to see how different titles impacts the rating of the books. The title suggestion can be done using a LLM models like GPT, llama etc. 

2. Recommendation system: Using the same feature as above, we designed a simple system from ground up which was explainable. We did not use a deep learning for the recommendation system and therefore it is very explainable.
